### What do we need ? 

 - Text editor ([Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/))
 - Browser ([Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/es_es/chrome/))

 - In it's essence HTML doesn't need a server to run
 - Files must end in format **.html**
 - Runs in a browser
 - **index.html** is the root/home page of a website
   - What this means is:
     - http://foo.org loads **index.html**
     - http://foo.org/about.html loads **about.html**
 - We can start testing locally
 
### In order to make it public

 - Need to buy a domain
 - Hosting package
